A framework makes it simple to create pages! This project brought you a blurred
style laying out with posts. We define 5 basic components, Top, Major, Post,
Dropdown and Button, configuring by class list and other attributes.

# Interfaces
The binder introduces bindTo from binding a course of functions to that object.
The reflection lets you do type checking at runtime with constrainedWith. The
property-definer is for better object oriented. The function hardFreeze is to
assign a course of types to the object and protoize the class means its not be
inherited. The function lockFields is to define a course of keys to the instance
and mutable a key means the key corresponding value can be reassigned. The
function shareProperties is to enumerate the properties (with getter or setter)
and functions (just an callable) to the type and a static key means the key
corresponding value resides that type. The asynchronous lets you suspend the
control flow and resume back to its original state in asynchronous context. The
function suspend gives you an option to pass a function where the condition is
stated by returning a boolean value. The functionality incorporates a wealth of
interfaces for further manipulate the pages.
